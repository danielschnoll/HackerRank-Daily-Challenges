from collections import Counter

# RUNTIME:    Runs in O(n) - Counter creation is ||arr||, colloquially n. Lookup in arr
#             is a O(1) operation, and arr.index(), while O(n), is only done once.
#
# DISCUSSION: Funny enough, this problem doesn't even need a binary search despite the
#             editorial/problem statement suggesting it. This was easily solvable with
#             a greedy/two pointers approach. We make the counter for instant lookup
#             and to account for duplicates, and iterate over every i in arr checking
#             if the difference between m and arr[i] exists in the counter. This means
#             there is a locally optimal pair that exists within arr so we return i and
#             the index of that pair-value.

# Complete the 'icecreamParlor' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER m
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY arr

            # this check is necessary because we might have an ex like m = 548 and arr[i] = 274, and
            # 274 is only in arr once. 548-274=274, and since no (274, 274) pair exists in arr, this
            # will throw an error on arr.index after we arr.remove(274)
